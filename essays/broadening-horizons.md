I consider myself someone who is always open to learning new things, though it is most manageable and enjoyable for me to learn when I am interested in the subject matter. Software engineering happens to fall within these guidelines. My interest in software engineering stems from a lifelong love for puzzles and creativity. Even as a child, I was always fascinated with any sort of creative outlet I could get my hands on. By elementary school, I had already learned various crafts such as knitting, crocheting, sewing by hand and machine, painting, and drawing.  At the same time, I found myself captivated by puzzles, any kind, but especially jigsaw puzzles and sudoku. Puzzles often go hand in hand with creativity, where often a creative and clever solution is needed to solve, I find the same is also true for software engineering.

Software engineering is far more than just writing code, rather it is about solving problems and designing systems that work well together. Coding feels like putting together a puzzle, where every line of code adds to the bigger picture. Thankfully, I have been preparing my problem-solving and creative thinking skills since I was very young, so I am ready for all that lies ahead of me. On a similar note, I am looking forward to learning new languages as I dive deeper into software engineering. Each new language I learn feels like I am starting a new kind of puzzle, hard at the beginning, but if I keep at it, then it comes to me with ease.
 
Additionally, I hope to learn more about and work with technologies such as the GitHub project hosting, Bootstrap 5 user interface framework, and Nextjs web application. While unfamiliar with these technologies, I am eager to gain hands-on experience and to have the opportunity to grow my skill set. By learning these tools now, I am setting myself up for success in future job prospects with these experiences and building my professional portfolio. I can see software engineering rising on the horizon with a whole world of opportunities and stepping stones to my future.
