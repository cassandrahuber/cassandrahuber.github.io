This research project explored the impact of English, as a product of linguistic imperialism, on the identity of Filipinos and Filipino Americans. The study involved creating and distributing a survey within Filipino/Tagalog online communities to understand how English affects participants' sense of cultural identity. The research question focused on the ways in which English has shaped the self-perception of Filipino identity, specifically asking whether English is seen as a tool for cultural integration or as a barrier to authentic identity expression. The survey collected data on attitudes toward the role of English in daily communication, social interactions, and its  involvement on Filipino heritage.

I designed the survey and developed the research methodology, focusing on the cross between language, identity, and historical colonial influences. To distribute the survey, I borrowed a peer's Reddit account to post in relevant Filipino/Tagalog discussion forums, as my own account did not meet the Forums' guidelines requiring a 3-day age for posting. After collecting 30 responses, I analyzed the data to identify trends, such as feelings of alienation or empowerment tied to English usage. I was responsible for interpreting the results and integrate them with existing academic research on linguistic imperialism, cultural identity, and the role of language in societal hierarchy. I then combinded the findings into a report that linked the participants' experiences to historical and ongoing social dynamics in the Philippines.

Through this project, I deepened my understanding of research methods, data collection, and analysis. The experience improved my ability to design meaningful survey questions and interpret qualitative data. I also gained insights into language's complex role in shaping cultural identity, particularly in post-colonial contexts. As a Filipino American, this project was especially relatable, as it allowed me to reflect on my own experiences with language and identity. Even further, by analyzing the intersection of language, identity, and social hierarchy, I learned how language ideologies continue to influence personal and communal perceptions of self and culture.
