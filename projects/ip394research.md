This research project explored the impact of English, as a product of linguistic imperialism, on the identity of Filipinos and Filipino Americans. The study involved creating and distributing a survey within Filipino/Tagalog online communities to understand how English affects participants' sense of cultural identity. The research question focused on the ways in which English has shaped the self-perception of Filipino identity, specifically asking whether English is seen as a tool for cultural integration or as a barrier to authentic identity expression. The survey collected data on attitudes toward the role of English in daily communication, social interactions, and its broader implications on Filipino heritage.

I designed the survey and developed the research methodology, focusing on the intersection of language, identity, and historical colonial influences. To distribute the survey, I borrowed a peer's Reddit account to post in relevant Filipino/Tagalog discussion forums, as my own account did not meet the Forums' guidelines requiring a 3-day age for posting. After collecting 30 responses, I analyzed the data to identify trends, such as feelings of alienation or empowerment tied to English usage. I was responsible for interpreting the results and integrate them with existing academic research on linguistic imperialism, cultural identity, and the role of language in societal hierarchy. I then combinded the findings into a report that linked the participants' experiences to historical and ongoing social dynamics in the Philippines.

Through this project, I deepened my understanding of sociolinguistic research methods, data collection, and analysis. The experience honed my ability to design meaningful survey questions and interpret qualitative data. I also gained insights into the complexities of language's role in shaping cultural identity, particularly in post-colonial contexts. By analyzing the intersection of language, identity, and social hierarchy, I learned how language ideologies continue to influence personal and communal perceptions of self and culture. This research also improved my academic writing and reporting skills, as I had to present complex findings in a clear and accessible manner.
